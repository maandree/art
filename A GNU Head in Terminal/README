This is a version of a GNU Head that can be printed into
the Linux TTY and XTerm-256colour-compatible terminals.

Requires UTF-8 encoding to be enabled at at least 72 columns
in your terminal.

It can not be printed into the Hurd TTY due to leak of
terminal capabilities.

Should look perfect in xterm with default settings, or
in VTE-based, or similar, terminal if using the font Fixed.
